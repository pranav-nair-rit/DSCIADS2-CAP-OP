Otherwise it defines the type of icon: ||  ||    * ``1`` - Unicode character ||    * ``2`` - HTML tag for special fonts: ``<i class=\""fa fa-beer\""><\/i>`` ||    * ``3`` - png image **Future feature - specification incomplete** ||    * ``4`` - svg image **Future feature - specification incomplete** ||  || Icon (Text \/ None) ||    A shorter version of the name. The Icon must be compatible to the specified type. ||  || Color (Text \/ None) ||    A HTML-like color code that can be used to highlight a very special tag. Do not use this feature too much; it can break the UI visual design. ||  || PosX; PosY (Integer \/ None) ||    The (X;Y) Position of the Name or the Icon in a grid if the tags were presented as grid in an UI. ||    The tag position gets stored in the global database to make sure that every UI provides a similar layout of the tags to make it more usable. ||    ``(0;0)`` is the upper left corner. ||    If not a grid but a list gets described; ``posx`` determines the position and ``posy`` is set to ``NULL``. ||  ||  || Tag Mapping Table || ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ||  || The mapping-tables have all the same layout ||  ||     +----------+----------+----------+------------+----------+ ||     | 0        | 1        | 2        | 3          | 4        | ||     +----------+----------+----------+------------+----------+ ||     | EntryID  | SongID   | TagID    | Confidence | Approval | ||     +----------+----------+----------+------------+----------+ ||     | EntryID  | AlbumID  | TagID    | Confidence | Approval | ||     +----------+----------+----------+------------+----------+ ||  || EntryID (Integer) ||    ID of the entry in the mapping-table ||  || TagID (Integer) ||    ID of the tag in the Tag-Definition-Table ||  || xxxID (Integer) ||    ID of the song or album entry in the related tables ||  || Confidence (Floating point; Default: 1.0) ||    Confidence that the tag is correct. ||    This is important in case an AI set the tag (See *Approval*). ||    Otherwise this column can be ignored. - Ignoring means setting it to ``1.0``! ||     || Approval (Integer; Default: 1) ||    Three stages to approve the tag. ||  ||    * ``0`` - Set by AI.

It servers the audio stream to the world. ||  ||     Listener: ||         The listener is the receiver of the stream. For example VLC. ||  || Icecast can handle multiple sources. || Each source is used for the input of a *Mountpoint*. || All *Listeners* that want to access the audio stream receives the data from this Mountpoint's output. ||  || For more details see the `Icecast Documentation <https:\/\/icecast.org\/docs\/icecast-trunk\/basic_setup\/>`_. ||  ||  || Icecast Configuration || ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ||  || The Icecast configuration defines the *Source Client* and how the data from the Source Clients gets served to the listeners. ||  || In this section; I only point out the more important settings of the whole Icecast configuration. || There is a good example configuration provided by MusicDB. || The following list addresses the settings in the XML file for the Icecast configration. ||  ||     icecast\/authentication\/source-password: ||         This is the password *MusicDB* needs to know to connect to Icecast. ||         So this password must be the same as in MusicDB Configuration ``[icecast]->password``. ||  || There are two ports needed for the MusicDB\/Icecast setup. || One port to connect MusicDB to Icecast; and one to provide the stream to Listeners. || The MusicDB connection (Port 6666) is bound to localhost and not encrypted. || The other port (666) can be open to the world because it will be encrypted and protected against unwanted access. ||  || The ports will be configured in the ``icecast`` section of the configuration file by adding ``listen-socket`` sections: ||  ||     .. code-block:: xml ||  ||         <!-- Extern --> ||         <listen-socket> ||             <port>666<\/port> ||             <ssl>1<\/ssl> ||         <\/listen-socket> ||  ||         <!-- Intern --> ||         <listen-socket> ||             <port>6666<\/port> ||             <ssl>0<\/ssl> ||             <shoutcast-mount>\/stream<\/shoutcast-mount> ||         <\/listen-socket> ||  ||  ||     icecast\/listen-socket\/shoutcast-mount: ||         This setting defines the *Mountpoint* name (starting with \""\/\""). ||         It must be the same like the one set in MusicDB's configuration: ``[icecast]->mountname`` ||         Further more it must be equal to the name definded in the detailed mount specification: ``icecast\/mount\/mount-name``. ||  ||  || User Management || ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ||  || TODO: ||  || How to remove access validation. ||  || How to create a new user ||  ||  || \""\""\""",No,Yes,Yes

Because of the automatic || import; this is no longer necessary (but code that does it still || works). ||  || This will append site-specific paths to the module search path.

On other platforms (mainly Mac and || Windows); it uses just sys.prefix (and sys.exec_prefix; if different; || but this is unlikely).  The resulting directories; if they exist; are || appended to sys.path; and also inspected for path configuration files. ||  || FOR DEBIAN; this sys.path is augmented with directories in \/usr\/local. || Local addons go into \/usr\/local\/lib\/python<version>\/site-packages || (resp. \/usr\/local\/lib\/site-python); Debian addons install into || \/usr\/{lib;share}\/python<version>\/dist-packages. ||  || A path configuration file is a file whose name has the form || <package>.pth; its contents are additional directories (one per line) || to be added to sys.path.

Lines starting with 'import' are executed. ||  || For example; suppose sys.prefix and sys.exec_prefix are set to || \/usr\/local and there is a directory \/usr\/local\/lib\/python2.X\/site-packages || with three subdirectories; foo; bar and spam; and two path || configuration files; foo.pth and bar.pth.

2248,2392,"\""\""\""3. Inference with Quantized Models || ===================================== ||  || This is a tutorial which illustrates how to use quantized GluonCV || models for inference on Intel Xeon Processors to gain higher performance. ||  || The following example requires ``GluonCV>=0.4`` and ``MXNet-mkl>=1.5.0b20190314``. Please follow `our installation guide <..\/..\/index.html#installation>`__ to install or upgrade GluonCV and nightly build of MXNet if necessary. ||  || Introduction || ------------ ||  || GluonCV delivered some quantized models to improve the performance and reduce the deployment costs for the computer vision inference tasks. In real production; there are two main benefits of lower precision (INT8). First; the computation can be accelerated by the low precision instruction; like Intel Vector Neural Network Instruction (VNNI). Second; lower precision data type would save the memory bandwidth and allow for better cache locality and save the power. The new feature can get up to 2X performance speedup in the current AWS EC2 CPU instances and will reach 4X under the `Intel Deep Learning Boost (VNNI) <https:\/\/www.intel.ai\/intel-deep-learning-boost\/#gs.0ngn54>`_ enabled hardware with less than 0.5% accuracy drop. ||  || Please checkout `verify_pretrained.py <https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/dmlc\/gluon-cv\/master\/scripts\/classification\/imagenet\/verify_pretrained.py>`_ for imagenet inference || and `eval_ssd.py <https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/dmlc\/gluon-cv\/master\/scripts\/detection\/ssd\/eval_ssd.py>`_ for SSD inference. ||  || Performance || ----------- ||  || GluonCV supports some quantized classification models and detection models. || For the throughput; the target is to achieve the maximum machine efficiency to combine the inference requests together and get the results by one iteration. From the bar-chart; it is clearly that the quantization approach improved the throughput from 1.46X to 2.71X for selected models. || Below CPU performance is from AWS EC2 C5.18xlarge with 18 cores. ||  || .. figure:: https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/17897736\/54540947-dc08c480-49d3-11e9-9a0d-a97d44f9792c.png ||    :alt: Gluon Quantization Performance ||  ||    Gluon Quantization Performance ||  || +-----------------------+----------+------------+------------------+------------------+---------+-----------------+-----------------+ || |  Model                | Dataset  | Batch Size | C5.18xlarge FP32 | C5.18xlarge INT8 | Speedup | FP32 Accuracy   | INT8 Accuracy   | || +=======================+==========+============+==================+==================+=========+=================+=================+ || | ResNet50 V1           | ImageNet | 128        | 122.02           | 276.72           | 2.27    | 77.21%\/93.55%   | 76.86%\/93.46%   | || +-----------------------+----------+------------+------------------+------------------+---------+-----------------+-----------------+ || | MobileNet 1.0         | ImageNet | 128        | 375.33           | 1016.39          | 2.71    | 73.28%\/91.22%   | 72.85%\/90.99%   | || +-----------------------+----------+------------+------------------+------------------+---------+-----------------+-----------------+ || | SSD-VGG 300*          | VOC      | 224        | 21.55            | 31.47            | 1.46    | 77.4            | 77.46           | || +-----------------------+----------+------------+------------------+------------------+---------+-----------------+-----------------+ || | SSD-VGG 512*          | VOC      | 224        | 7.63             | 11.69            | 1.53    | 78.41           | 78.39           | || +-----------------------+----------+------------+------------------+------------------+---------+-----------------+-----------------+ || | SSD-resnet50_v1 512*  | VOC      | 224        | 17.81            | 34.55            | 1.94    | 80.21           | 80.16           | || +-----------------------+----------+------------+------------------+------------------+---------+-----------------+-----------------+ || | SSD-mobilenet1.0 512* | VOC      | 224        | 31.13            | 48.72            | 1.57    | 75.42           | 75.04           | || +-----------------------+----------+------------+------------------+------------------+---------+-----------------+-----------------+ ||  || Quantized SSD models are evaluated with ``nms_thresh=0.45``; ``nms_topk=200``. ||  || Demo usage for SSD || ------------------ ||  || .. code:: bash ||  ||    # with Pascal VOC validation dataset saved on disk ||    python eval_ssd.py --network=vgg16_atrous --quantized --data-shape=300 --batch-size=224 --dataset=voc ||  || Usage: ||  || :: ||  ||    SYNOPSIS ||             python eval_ssd.py [-h] [--network NETWORK] [--quantized] ||                                [--data-shape DATA_SHAPE] [--batch-size BATCH_SIZE] ||                                [--dataset DATASET] [--num-workers NUM_WORKERS] ||                                [--num-gpus NUM_GPUS] [--pretrained PRETRAINED] ||                                [--save-prefix SAVE_PREFIX] ||  ||    OPTIONS ||             -h; --help            show this help message and exit ||             --network NETWORK     Base network name ||             --quantized           use int8 pretrained model ||             --data-shape DATA_SHAPE ||                                     Input data shape ||             --batch-size BATCH_SIZE ||                                     eval mini-batch size ||             --dataset DATASET     eval dataset. ||             --num-workers NUM_WORKERS; -j NUM_WORKERS ||                                     Number of data workers ||             --num-gpus NUM_GPUS   number of gpus to use. ||             --pretrained PRETRAINED ||                                     Load weights from previously saved parameters. ||             --save-prefix SAVE_PREFIX ||                                     Saving parameter prefix || \""\""\""",No,Yes,Yes

On other platforms (mainly Mac and || Windows); it uses just sys.prefix (and sys.exec_prefix; if different; || but this is unlikely).  The resulting directories; if they exist; are || appended to sys.path; and also inspected for path configuration files. ||  || FOR DEBIAN; this sys.path is augmented with directories in \/usr\/local. || Local addons go into \/usr\/local\/lib\/python<version>\/site-packages || (resp. \/usr\/local\/lib\/site-python); Debian addons install into || \/usr\/{lib;share}\/python<version>\/dist-packages. ||  || A path configuration file is a file whose name has the form || <package>.pth; its contents are additional directories (one per line) || to be added to sys.path.

This task is known as X{parsing} || the text; and the resulting tree structures are called the text's || X{parses}.  Typically; the text is a single sentence; and the tree || structure represents the syntactic structure of the sentence. || However; parsers can also be used in other domains.

3978,4196,"\""\""\"" || Overview || ======== ||  || This module provides data structures for representing first-order || models. A model is a pair M{<D;V>}; where M{D} is a domain of discourse and || M{V} is a valuation function for the non-logical constants of a || first-order language. We assume that the language is based on the || lambda calculus; in the style of Montague grammar. ||  ||  || We also assume that non-logical constants are either individual constants || or functors. In particular; rather than interpreting a one-place || predicate M{P} as a set M{S}; we interpret it as the corresponding || characteristic function M{f}; where M{f(a) = True} iff M{a} is in || M{S}. For example; instead of interpreting 'dog' as the set of || individuals M{{'d1'; 'd2'; 'd3'}}; we interpret it as the function || which maps 'd1'; 'd2' and 'd3' to M{True} and every other entity to || M{False}. ||  || Thus; as a first approximation; non-logical constants are interpreted || by the valuation M{V} as follows (note that M{e} is the type of || I{entities} and M{t} is the type of truth values): ||  ||   - if S{alpha} is an individual constant; then M{V}(S{alpha}) ||     is an element of M{D}. ||   - If S{gamma} is a functor of type (M{e} x ... x M{e}) -> M{t}; then ||     M{V}(S{gamma}) is a function M{f} from  M{D} x ... x M{D} to M{{True; False}}. ||  || However; since we are basing our language on the lambda calculus (see || L{logic}); a binary relation such as 'like' will not in fact be || associated with the type (M{e} x M{e}) -> M{t}; but rather the type || (M{e} -> (M{e} -> M{t})); i.e.; a function from entities to a function || from entities to truth values. In other words; functors are assigned || 'Curried' functions as their values. It should also be noted that || expressions of the language are not explicitly typed.  We leave it to || the grammar writer to assign 'sensible' values to expressions rather || than enforcing any type-to-denotation consistency. ||  || Characteristic Functions || ======================== ||  || Within L{models}; Curried characteristic functions are implemented as || a subclass of dictionaries; using the L{CharFun} constructor. ||  ||    >>> cf = CharFun({'d1' : CharFun({'d2': True}); 'd2' : CharFun({'d1': True})}) ||  || Values of a L{CharFun} are accessed by indexing in the usual way: ||  ||    >>> cf['d1'] ||    {'d2': True} ||    >>> cf['d1']['d2'] ||    True ||  || L{CharFun}s are 'sparse' data structures in the sense that they omit || entries of the form C{e: False}. In fact; they || behave just like ordinary dictionaries on keys which are || out of their domain; rather than yielding the value C{False}: ||  ||    >>> cf['not in domain'] ||    Traceback (most recent call last): ||    ... ||    KeyError: 'not in domain' ||  || The assignment of C{False} values is delegated to a wrapper method || L{app} of the L{Model} class. L{app} embodies the Closed World || assumption; i.e.; where C{m} is an instance of L{Model}: ||  ||    >>> m.app(cf;'not in domain') ||    False ||  || It might be asked why we don't modify instances of L{CharFun} to give || the value C{False} in place of a C{KeyError} for some entity 'd3' || which is not a key for the dictionary. The reason is that this would || implement a behaviour equivalent to C{cf2} below; which yields the Boolean || C{False} for the entity 'd3' rather than a I{function} which yields || C{False} for every entity in the domain: ||  ||    >>> cf2 = {'d1': {'d2': True}; {'d3': False}} ||  || As a result; trying to evaluate something like C{cf2['d3']['d2']} would yield a || C{TypeError} rather than C{False}; as required. ||  || In practise; it will often be more convenient for a user to specify || interpretations as M{n}-ary relations (i.e.; sets of M{n}-tuples) rather || than as M{n}-ary functions. L{CharFun} provides a C{read} method which || will convert such relations into Curried characteristic functions: ||  ||    >>> s = set([('d1'; 'd2'); ('d3'; 'd4')]) ||    >>> cf = CharFun() ||    >>> cf.read(s) ||    >>> cf ||    {'d2': {'d1': True}; 'd4': {'d3': True}} ||  ||  || C{read} will raise an exception if the set is not in fact a || relation (i.e.; contains tuples of different lengths): ||  ||   >>> wrong = set([('d1'; 'd2'); ('d2'; 'd1'; 'd3')]) ||   >>> cf.read(wrong) ||   Traceback (most recent call last): ||   ... ||   ValueError: Set contains sequences of different lengths ||  || However; unary relations can be parsed to characteristic functions. ||  ||   >>> unary = set(['d1'; 'd2']) ||   >>> cf.read(unary) ||   >>> cf ||   {'d2': True; 'd1': True} ||  || The function L{flatten} returns a set of the entities used as keys in || a L{CharFun} instance. The same information can be accessed via the || C{domain} attribute of L{CharFun}. ||  ||    >>> cf = CharFun({'d1' : {'d2': True}; 'd2' : {'d1': True}}) ||    >>> flatten(cf) ||    set(['d2'; 'd1']) ||    >>> cf.domain ||    set(['d2'; 'd1']) ||  || Valuations and Assignments || ========================== ||  || Valuations || ---------- ||  || A I{Valuation} is a mapping from non-logical constants to appropriate semantic || values in the model. Valuations are created using the L{Valuation} constructor. ||  ||    >>> val = Valuation({'Fido' : 'd1'; 'dog' : {'d1' : True; 'd2' : True}}) ||    >>> val ||    {'Fido': 'd1'; 'dog': {'d2': True; 'd1': True}} ||  || As with L{CharFun}; an instance of L{Valuation} will read valuations using || relations rather than characteristic functions as interpretations. ||  ||    >>> setval = [('adam'; 'b1'); ('betty'; 'g1');\\ ||    ('girl'; set(['g2'; 'g1'])); ('boy'; set(['b1'; 'b2']));\\ ||    ('love'; set([('b1'; 'g1'); ('b2'; 'g2'); ('g1'; 'b1'); ('g2'; 'b1')]))] ||    >>> val = Valuation() ||    >>> val.read(setval) ||    >>> print val ||    {'adam': 'b1'; ||    'betty': 'g1'; ||    'boy': {'b1': True; 'b2': True}; ||    'girl': {'g2': True; 'g1': True}; ||    'love': {'b1': {'g2': True; 'g1': True}; ||             'g1': {'b1': True}; ||             'g2': {'b2': True}}} ||  || Valuations have a C{domain} attribute; like L{CharFun}; and also a C{symbols} || attribute. ||  ||    >>> val.domain ||    set(['g1'; 'g2'; 'b2'; 'b1']) ||    >>> val.symbols ||    ['boy'; 'girl'; 'love'; 'adam'; 'betty']    ||  ||  || Assignments || ----------- ||  || A variable I{Assignment} is a mapping from individual variables to || entities in the domain. Individual variables are indicated with the || letters 'x'; 'y'; 'w' and 'z'; optionally followed by an integer || (e.g.; 'x0'; 'y332').  Assignments are created using the L{Assignment} || constructor; which also takes the domain as a parameter. ||  ||    >>> dom = set(['u1'; 'u2'; 'u3'; 'u4']) ||    >>> g = Assignment(dom; {'x': 'u1'; 'y': 'u2'}) ||    >>> g ||    {'y': 'u2'; 'x': 'u1'} ||  || There is also a C{print} format for assignments which uses a notation || closer to that in logic textbooks: ||     ||    >>> print g ||    g[u2\/y][u1\/x] ||  || Initialization of an L{Assignment} instance checks that the variable || really is an individual variable and also that the value belongs to || the domain of discourse: ||  ||     >>> Assignment(dom; {'xxx': 'u1'; 'y': 'u2'}) ||     Traceback (most recent call last): ||     ... ||     AssertionError: Wrong format for an Individual Variable: 'xxx' ||     >>> Assignment(dom; {'x': 'u5'; 'y': 'u2'}) ||     Traceback (most recent call last): ||     ... ||     AssertionError: 'u5' is not in the domain: set(['u4'; 'u1'; 'u3'; 'u2']) ||  || It is also possible to update an assignment using the L{add} method: ||  ||     >>> dom = set(['u1'; 'u2'; 'u3'; 'u4']) ||     >>> g = models.Assignment(dom; {}) ||     >>> g.add('u1'; 'x') ||     {'x': 'u1'} ||     >>> g.add('u1'; 'xyz') ||     Traceback (most recent call last): ||     ... ||     AssertionError: Wrong format for an Individual Variable: 'xyz' ||     >>> g.add('u2'; 'x').add('u3'; 'y').add('u4'; 'x0') ||     {'y': 'u3'; 'x': 'u2'; 'x0': 'u4'} ||     >>> g.add('u5'; 'x') ||     Traceback (most recent call last): ||     ... ||     AssertionError: u5 is not in the domain set(['u4'; 'u1'; 'u3'; 'u2']) ||  || Variables (and their values) can be selectively removed from an || assignment with the L{purge} method: ||  ||     >>> g ||     {'y': 'u3'; 'x': 'u2'; 'x0': 'u4'} ||     >>> g.purge('x') ||     >>> g ||     {'y': 'u3'; 'x0': 'u4'} ||  || With no arguments;  L{purge} is equivalent to C{clear} on a dictionary: ||  ||     >>> g.purge() ||     >>> g ||     {} ||  ||  ||  ||  || Models || ====== ||  || The L{Model} constructor takes two parameters; a C{set} and a L{Valuation}. ||  ||    >>> m = Model(val.domain; val) ||  || The top-level method of a L{Model} instance is L{evaluate}; which || assigns a semantic value to expressions of the L{logic} module; under an assignment C{g}: ||  ||     >>> m.evaluate('all x. ((boy x) implies (not (girl x)))'; g) ||     True ||  || evaluate || -------- ||  || L{evaluate} calls a recursive function L{satisfy}; which in turn || calls a function L{i} to interpret non-logical constants and || individual variables. L{i} first tries to call the model's L{Valuation} and || if that fails; calls the variable assignment C{g}. Any atomic expression which cannot be || assigned a value by L{i} raises an C{Undefined} exception; this is || caught by L{evaluate}; which returns the string 'Undefined'. ||  ||     >>> m.evaluate('(walk adam)'; g; trace=2) ||        ... checking whether 'walk' is an individual variable ||     Expression 'walk' can't be evaluated by i and g. ||     'Undefined' ||  ||  ||  || Boolean operators such as M{not}; M{and} and M{implies} are || implemented as dictionaries.

Because of the automatic || import; this is no longer necessary (but code that does it still || works). ||  || This will append site-specific paths to the module search path.  On || Unix; it starts with sys.prefix and sys.exec_prefix (if different) and || appends lib\/python<version>\/site-packages as well as lib\/site-python. || It also supports the Debian convention of || lib\/python<version>\/dist-packages.  On other platforms (mainly Mac and || Windows); it uses just sys.prefix (and sys.exec_prefix; if different; || but this is unlikely).  The resulting directories; if they exist; are || appended to sys.path; and also inspected for path configuration files. ||  || FOR DEBIAN; this sys.path is augmented with directories in \/usr\/local. || Local addons go into \/usr\/local\/lib\/python<version>\/site-packages || (resp. \/usr\/local\/lib\/site-python); Debian addons install into || \/usr\/{lib;share}\/python<version>\/dist-packages. ||  || A path configuration file is a file whose name has the form || <package>.pth; its contents are additional directories (one per line) || to be added to sys.path.  Non-existing directories (or || non-directories) are never added to sys.path; no directory is added to || sys.path more than once.  Blank lines and lines beginning with || '#' are skipped. Lines starting with 'import' are executed. ||  || For example; suppose sys.prefix and sys.exec_prefix are set to || \/usr\/local and there is a directory \/usr\/local\/lib\/python2.X\/site-packages || with three subdirectories; foo; bar and spam; and two path || configuration files; foo.pth and bar.pth.  Assume foo.pth contains the || following: ||  ||   # foo package configuration ||   foo ||   bar ||   bletch ||  || and bar.pth contains: ||  ||   # bar package configuration ||   bar ||  || Then the following directories are added to sys.path; in this order: ||  ||   \/usr\/local\/lib\/python2.X\/site-packages\/bar ||   \/usr\/local\/lib\/python2.X\/site-packages\/foo ||  || Note that bletch is omitted because it doesn't exist; bar precedes foo || because bar.pth comes alphabetically before foo.pth; and spam is || omitted because it is not mentioned in either path configuration file. ||  || After these path manipulations; an attempt is made to import a module || named sitecustomize; which can perform arbitrary additional || site-specific customizations.  If this import fails with an || ImportError exception; it is silently ignored. ||  || \""\""\""",No,Yes,Yes

6078,6466,"r\""\""\"" This module provides functions and operations for bipartite || graphs.  Bipartite graphs `B = (U; V; E)` have two node sets `U;V` and edges in || `E` that only connect nodes from opposite sets. It is common in the literature || to use an spatial analogy referring to the two node sets as top and bottom nodes. ||  || The bipartite algorithms are not imported into the networkx namespace || at the top level so the easiest way to use them is with: ||  || >>> import networkx as nx || >>> from networkx.algorithms import bipartite ||  || NetworkX does not have a custom bipartite graph class but the Graph() || or DiGraph() classes can be used to represent bipartite graphs. However; || you have to keep track of which set each node belongs to; and make || sure that there is no edge between nodes of the same set. The convention used || in NetworkX is to use a node attribute named `bipartite` with values 0 or 1 to || identify the sets each node belongs to. This convention is not enforced in || the source code of bipartite functions; it's only a recommendation. ||   || For example: ||  || >>> B = nx.Graph() || >>> # Add nodes with the node attribute \""bipartite\"" || >>> B.add_nodes_from([1; 2; 3; 4]; bipartite=0) || >>> B.add_nodes_from(['a'; 'b'; 'c']; bipartite=1) || >>> # Add edges only between nodes of opposite node sets || >>> B.add_edges_from([(1; 'a'); (1; 'b'); (2; 'b'); (2; 'c'); (3; 'c'); (4; 'a')]) ||  || Many algorithms of the bipartite module of NetworkX require; as an argument; a || container with all the nodes that belong to one set; in addition to the bipartite || graph `B`. The functions in the bipartite package do not check that the node set || is actually correct nor that the input graph is actually bipartite. || If `B` is connected; you can find the two node sets using a two-coloring  || algorithm:  ||  || >>> nx.is_connected(B) || True || >>> bottom_nodes; top_nodes = bipartite.sets(B) ||  || However; if the input graph is not connected; there are more than one possible || colorations. This is the reason why we require the user to pass a container || with all nodes of one bipartite node set as an argument to most bipartite || functions. In the face of ambiguity; we refuse the temptation to guess and || raise an :exc:`AmbiguousSolution <networkx.AmbiguousSolution>` || Exception if the input graph for || :func:`bipartite.sets <networkx.algorithms.bipartite.basic.sets>` || is disconnected. ||  || Using the `bipartite` node attribute; you can easily get the two node sets: ||  || >>> top_nodes = {n for n; d in B.nodes(data=True) if d['bipartite']==0} || >>> bottom_nodes = set(B) - top_nodes ||  || So you can easily use the bipartite algorithms that require; as an argument; a || container with all nodes that belong to one node set: ||  || >>> print(round(bipartite.density(B; bottom_nodes); 2)) || 0.5 || >>> G = bipartite.projected_graph(B; top_nodes) ||  || All bipartite graph generators in NetworkX build bipartite graphs with the  || `bipartite` node attribute. Thus; you can use the same approach: ||  || >>> RB = bipartite.random_graph(5; 7; 0.2) || >>> RB_top = {n for n; d in RB.nodes(data=True) if d['bipartite']==0} || >>> RB_bottom = set(RB) - RB_top || >>> list(RB_top) || [0; 1; 2; 3; 4] || >>> list(RB_bottom) || [5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11] ||  || For other bipartite graph generators see || :mod:`Generators <networkx.algorithms.bipartite.generators>`. ||  || \""\""\""",No,Yes,Yes

Usually this means it is just the || statement type (or verb); subject name; and object name; though in some corner || cases it is different. ||  || Simple Example || -------------- ||  || The primary work horse of the module is `group_and_sort_statements`; and if you || want statements grouped into agent-pairs; then by relations; sorted by evidence || count; you can simply use this function with its defaults: ||  || >>> for _; ag_key; rels; ag_metrics in group_and_sort_statements(stmts): || >>>     print(ag_key) || >>>     for _; rel_key; stmt_group; rel_metrics in rels: || >>>         print('\\t'; rel_key) || >>>         for _; stmt_hash; stmt_obj; stmt_metrics in stmt_group: || >>>             print('\\t\\t'; stmt_obj) ||  || Advanced Example || ---------------- ||  || However; say you have your own measurement of statements; want them grouped only || to the level of relations; and want to sort the statements and relations || separately; you can do that. Suppose also that your measurement is the same || at the level of relations; and you don't want it aggregated. ||  || >>> # Define a new aggregator that takes the last metric (a noop given the || >>> # nature of the data) || >>> class NoopAggregator(BasicAggregator): || >>>     def _merge(self; metric_array): || >>>         self.values = metric_array || >>> || >>> # Create your StmtStat || >>> my_stat = StmtStat('my_stat'; my_data; int; NoopAggregator) || >>> || >>> # Define a custom sort function using my stat and the default available || >>> # ev_count. In effect this will sort relations by the custom stat; and then || >>> # sort the statements within that relation (for which my_stat is by design || >>> # the same) using their evidence counts. || >>> def my_sort(metrics): || >>>     return metrics['my_stat']; metrics['ev_count'] || >>> || >>> # Create the base statement group. || >>> base_group = StmtGroup.from_stmt_stats(my_stat) || >>> || >>> # Iterate over the results. || >>> groups = group_and_sort_statements(stmts; sort_by=my_sort; || >>>                                    base_group=base_group; || >>>                                    grouping_level='relation') || >>> for _; rel_key; rel_stmts; rel_metrics in groups: || >>>     print(rel_key; rel_metrics['my_stat']) || >>>     for _; stmt_hash; stmt; metrics in rel_stmts: || >>>         print('\\t'; stmt; metrics['ev_count']) || \""\""\""",No,Yes,Yes

Among others; this class || includes: ||  || * Neural Networks || * Tree-based methods such as Random Forests; and the very powerful Gradient ||   Boosting Machines [#xgboost]_ || * Kernel Methods. ||  ||  || Non-linear models can sometimes outperform linear ones; as they are able to || grasp more complex relationships between the input and the output of a machine || learning problem. However; using a non-linear model model often comes at a || cost: ||  || * for neural networks; this cost is an extended model tuning time; in order to ||   achieve good optimization and network architecture. || * gradient boosting machines do not tend to scale extremely well with ||   increasing sample size; as all the data needs to be loaded into the main ||   memory. || * for kernel methods; parameter fitting requires the inversion of a gram matrix ||   of size :math:`n \\times m` (:math:`n` being the number of samples); yiedling ||   a quadratic dependency (with n) in the final compmutation time. ||  ||  || All is not lost though.

It provides methods and Pythonic idioms that make || it easy to navigate; search; and modify the tree. ||  || A well-formed XML\/HTML document yields a well-formed data || structure. An ill-formed XML\/HTML document yields a correspondingly || ill-formed data structure. If your document is only locally || well-formed; you can use this library to find and process the || well-formed part of it. ||  || Beautiful Soup works with Python 2.2 and up. It has no external || dependencies; but you'll have more success at converting data to UTF-8 || if you also install these three packages: ||  || * chardet; for auto-detecting character encodings ||   http:\/\/chardet.feedparser.org\/ || * cjkcodecs and iconv_codec; which add more encodings to the ones supported ||   by stock Python. ||   http:\/\/cjkpython.i18n.org\/ ||  || Beautiful Soup defines classes for two main parsing strategies: ||  ||  * BeautifulStoneSoup; for parsing XML; SGML; or your domain-specific ||    language that kind of looks like XML. ||  ||  * BeautifulSoup; for parsing run-of-the-mill HTML code; be it valid ||    or invalid.

Because of the automatic || import; this is no longer necessary (but code that does it still || works). ||  || This will append site-specific paths to the module search path.  On || Unix; it starts with sys.prefix and sys.exec_prefix (if different) and || appends lib\/python<version>\/site-packages as well as lib\/site-python. || It also supports the Debian convention of || lib\/python<version>\/dist-packages.  On other platforms (mainly Mac and || Windows); it uses just sys.prefix (and sys.exec_prefix; if different; || but this is unlikely).  The resulting directories; if they exist; are || appended to sys.path; and also inspected for path configuration files. ||  || FOR DEBIAN; this sys.path is augmented with directories in \/usr\/local. || Local addons go into \/usr\/local\/lib\/python<version>\/site-packages || (resp. \/usr\/local\/lib\/site-python); Debian addons install into || \/usr\/{lib;share}\/python<version>\/dist-packages. ||  || A path configuration file is a file whose name has the form || <package>.pth; its contents are additional directories (one per line) || to be added to sys.path.

16288,17481,"\""\""\"" || Implementations of inter-annotator agreement coefficients surveyed by Artstein || and Poesio (2007); Inter-Coder Agreement for Computational Linguistics. ||  || An agreement coefficient calculates the amount that annotators agreed on label || assignments beyond what is expected by chance. ||  || In defining the AnnotationTask class; we use naming conventions similar to the || paper's terminology.  There are three types of objects in an annotation task: ||  ||     the coders (variables \""c\"" and \""C\"") ||     the items to be annotated (variables \""i\"" and \""I\"") ||     the potential categories to be assigned (variables \""k\"" and \""K\"") ||  || Additionally; it is often the case that we don't want to treat two different || labels as complete disagreement; and so the AnnotationTask constructor can also || take a distance metric as a final argument.  Distance metrics are simply || functions that take two arguments; and return a value between 0.0 and 1.0 || indicating the distance between them.  If not supplied; the default is binary || comparison between the arguments. ||  || The simplest way to initialize an AnnotationTask is with a list of triples; || each containing a coder's assignment for one object in the task: ||  ||     task = AnnotationTask(data=[('c1'; '1'; 'v1');('c2'; '1'; 'v1');...]) ||  || Note that the data list needs to contain the same number of triples for each || individual coder; containing category values for the same set of items. ||  || Alpha (Krippendorff 1980) || Kappa (Cohen 1960) || S (Bennet; Albert and Goldstein 1954) || Pi (Scott 1955) ||  ||  || TODO: Describe handling of multiple coders and missing data ||  || Expected results from the Artstein and Poesio survey paper: ||  ||     >>> from nltk.metrics.agreement import AnnotationTask ||     >>> import os.path ||     >>> t = AnnotationTask(data=[x.split() for x in open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__); \""artstein_poesio_example.txt\""))]) ||     >>> t.avg_Ao() ||     0.88 ||     >>> t.pi() ||     0.7995322418977615... ||     >>> t.S() ||     0.8199999999999998... ||  ||     This would have returned a wrong value (0.0) in @785fb79 as coders are in ||     the wrong order.

17544,18962,"\""\""\""Append module search paths for third-party packages to sys.path. ||  || **************************************************************** || * This module is automatically imported during initialization. * || **************************************************************** ||  || In earlier versions of Python (up to 1.5a3); scripts or modules that || needed to use site-specific modules would place ``import site'' || somewhere near the top of their code.  Because of the automatic || import; this is no longer necessary (but code that does it still || works). ||  || This will append site-specific paths to the module search path.  On || Unix; it starts with sys.prefix and sys.exec_prefix (if different) and || appends lib\/python<version>\/site-packages as well as lib\/site-python. || It also supports the Debian convention of || lib\/python<version>\/dist-packages.  On other platforms (mainly Mac and || Windows); it uses just sys.prefix (and sys.exec_prefix; if different; || but this is unlikely).  The resulting directories; if they exist; are || appended to sys.path; and also inspected for path configuration files. ||  || FOR DEBIAN; this sys.path is augmented with directories in \/usr\/local. || Local addons go into \/usr\/local\/lib\/python<version>\/site-packages || (resp. \/usr\/local\/lib\/site-python); Debian addons install into || \/usr\/{lib;share}\/python<version>\/dist-packages. ||  || A path configuration file is a file whose name has the form || <package>.pth; its contents are additional directories (one per line) || to be added to sys.path.  Non-existing directories (or || non-directories) are never added to sys.path; no directory is added to || sys.path more than once.  Blank lines and lines beginning with || '#' are skipped. Lines starting with 'import' are executed. ||  || For example; suppose sys.prefix and sys.exec_prefix are set to || \/usr\/local and there is a directory \/usr\/local\/lib\/python2.X\/site-packages || with three subdirectories; foo; bar and spam; and two path || configuration files; foo.pth and bar.pth.  Assume foo.pth contains the || following: ||  ||   # foo package configuration ||   foo ||   bar ||   bletch ||  || and bar.pth contains: ||  ||   # bar package configuration ||   bar ||  || Then the following directories are added to sys.path; in this order: ||  ||   \/usr\/local\/lib\/python2.X\/site-packages\/bar ||   \/usr\/local\/lib\/python2.X\/site-packages\/foo ||  || Note that bletch is omitted because it doesn't exist; bar precedes foo || because bar.pth comes alphabetically before foo.pth; and spam is || omitted because it is not mentioned in either path configuration file. ||  || After these path manipulations; an attempt is made to import a module || named sitecustomize; which can perform arbitrary additional || site-specific customizations.  If this import fails with an || ImportError exception; it is silently ignored. ||  || \""\""\""",No,Yes,Yes
