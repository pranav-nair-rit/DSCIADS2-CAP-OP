# DSCIADS2-CAP-OP

Final year Capstone presentation by Pranav Nair at the Rochester Institute Of Technology for the course DSCI-602 Applied Data Science - II. This capstone mainly focusses on the Annotation of code documents belonging to software repositories of Machine Learning applications and frameworks into  two caategories - Machine Learning Techincal Debts (MLTDs) and Non-Machine Learning Technical Debts (Non-MLTDs) using an approach that combines both Zero-Shot Classification using GPT-4.0 and Custom Binary Text Categorization, called Large Disagreement Modelling. 

The dataset for this project has been taken from the paper **23 Shades of Machine Learning** by O'Brien, David et.al. and it consists of around 68k code coomments of which 200 have been annotated as MLTDs and Non-MLTDs. We aim to annotate the rest of the samples using Large Disagreement Modelling.
