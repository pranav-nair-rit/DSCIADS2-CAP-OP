processors to gain higher performance         the following example requires   gluoncv  0 4   and   mxnet mkl  1 5 0b20190314    please follow  our installation guide          index html installation     to install or upgrade gluoncv and nightly build of mxnet if necessary         introduction                        gluoncv delivered some quantized models to improve the performance and reduce the deployment costs for the computer vision inference tasks  in real production  there are two main benefits of lower precision  int8   first  the computation can be accelerated by the low precision instruction  like intel vector neural network instruction  vnni   second  lower precision data type would save the memory bandwidth and allow for better cache locality and save the power  the new feature can get up to 2x performance speedup in the current aws ec2 cpu instances and will reach 4x under the  intel deep learning boost  vnni   https     www intel ai  intel deep learning boost   gs

    performance                       gluoncv supports some quantized classification models and detection models     for the throughput  the target is to achieve the maximum machine efficiency to combine the inference requests together and get the results by one iteration  from the bar chart  it is clearly that the quantization approach improved the throughput from 1 46x to 2 71x for selected models     below cpu performance is from aws ec2 c5 18xlarge with 18 cores            figure   https     user images githubusercontent com  17897736  54540947 dc08c480 49d3 11e9 9a0d a97d44f9792c png

4196,          overview                    this module provides data structures for representing first order    models  a model is a pair m  d v    where m d  is a domain of discourse and    m v  is a valuation function for the non logical constants of a    first order language  we assume that the language is based on the    lambda calculus  in the style of montague grammar             we also assume that non logical constants are either individual constants    or functors  in particular  rather than interpreting a one place    predicate m p  as a set m s   we interpret it as the corresponding    characteristic function m f   where m f a    true  iff m a  is in    m s   for example  instead of interpreting  dog  as the set of    individuals m   d1    d2    d3     we interpret it as the function    which maps  d1    d2  and  d3  to m true  and every other entity to    m false          thus  as a first approximation  non logical constants are interpreted    by the valuation m v  as follows  note that m e  is the type of    i entities  and m t  is the type of truth values              if s alpha  is an individual constant  then m v  s alpha          is an element of m d          if s gamma  is a functor of type  m e  x     x m e      m t   then        m v  s gamma   is a function m f  from  m d  x     x m d  to m  true  false           however  since we are basing our language on the lambda calculus  see    l logic    a binary relation such as  like  will not in fact be    associated with the type  m e  x m e      m t   but rather the type     m e      m e     m t     i e   a function from entities to a function    from entities to truth values  in other words  functors are assigned     curried  functions as their values  it should also be noted that    expressions of the language are not explicitly typed   we leave it to    the grammar writer to assign  sensible  values to expressions rather    than enforcing any type to denotation consistency         characteristic functions                                    within l models   curried characteristic functions are implemented as    a subclass of dictionaries  using the l charfun  constructor                cf   charfun   d1    charfun   d2   true     d2    charfun   d1   true            values of a l charfun  are accessed by indexing in the usual way                cf  d1           d2   true            cf  d1    d2         true        l charfun s are  sparse  data structures in the sense that they omit    entries of the form c e  false   in fact  they    behave just like ordinary dictionaries on keys which are    out of their domain  rather than yielding the value c false                 cf  not in domain         traceback  most recent call last                   keyerror   not in domain         the assignment of c false  values is delegated to a wrapper method    l app  of the l model  class  l app  embodies the closed world    assumption  i e   where c m  is an instance of l model                 m app cf  not in domain         false        it might be asked why we don t modify instances of l charfun  to give    the value c false  in place of a c keyerror  for some entity  d3     which is not a key for the dictionary  the reason is that this would    implement a behaviour equivalent to c cf2  below  which yields the boolean    c false  for the entity  d3  rather than a i function  which yields    c false  for every entity in the domain                cf2     d1     d2   true     d3   false          as a result  trying to evaluate something like c cf2  d3    d2    would yield a    c typeerror  rather than c false   as required         in practise  it will often be more convenient for a user to specify    interpretations as m n  ary relations  i e   sets of m n  tuples  rather    than as m n  ary functions  l charfun  provides a c read  method which    will convert such relations into curried characteristic functions                s   set
